= My plugins =

[Visitor Movies for WordPress](http://www.nkuttler.de/2010/05/21/record-movies-of-visitors/): Did you ever want to know what your visitors are really doing on your site? Watch them!

[Better tag cloud](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nktagcloud/): I was pretty unhappy with the default WordPress tag cloud widget. This one is more powerful and offers a list HTML markup that is consistent with most other widgets.

[Theme switch](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkthemeswitch/): I like to tweak my main theme that I use on a variety of blogs. If you have ever done this you know how annoying it can be to break things for visitors of your blog. This plugin allows you to use a different theme than the one used for your visitors when you are logged in.

[Zero Conf Mail](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/zero-conf-mail/): Simple mail contact form, the way I like it. No ajax, no bloat. No configuration necessary, but possible.

[Custom avatars for comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/custom-avatars-for-comments/): Add a personal touch: Your visitors will be able to choose from the avatars you upload to your website for each and every comment they make.

[Move WordPress comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkmovecomments/): This plugin adds a small form to every comment on your blog. The form is only added for admins and allows you to [move comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/nkmovecomments/) to a different post/page and to fix comment threading.

[Delete Pending Comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/delete-pending-comments): This is a plugin that lets you delete all pending comments at once. Useful for spam victims.

[Snow and more](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nksnow/): This one lets you see snowflakes, leaves, raindrops, balloons or custom images fall down or float upwards on your blog.

[Fireworks](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkfireworks/): The name says it all, see fireworks on your blog!

[Rhyming widget](http://www.rhymebox.de/blog/rhymebox-widget/): I wrote a little online [rhyming dictionary](http://www.rhymebox.com/). This is a widget to search it directly from one of your sidebars.
