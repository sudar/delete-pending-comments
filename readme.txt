<h3>My plugins</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nktagcloud/">Better tag cloud</a>:
I was pretty unhappy with the default WordPress tag cloud widget. This one is more powerful and offers a list HTML markup that is consistent with most other widgets.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkthemeswitch/">Theme switch</a>:
I like to tweak my main theme that I use on a variety of blogs. If you have ever done this you know how annoying it can be to break things for visitors of your blog. This plugin allows you to use a different theme than the one used for your visitors when you are logged in.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/zero-conf-mail/">Zero Conf Mail</a>:
Simple mail contact form, the way I like it. No ajax, no bloat. No configuration necessary, but possible.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkmovecomments/">Move WordPress comments</a>:
This plugin adds a small form to every comment on your blog. The form is only added for admins and allows you to <a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/nkmovecomments/">move comments</a> to a different post/page and to fix comment threading.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/delete-pending-comments">Delete Pending Comments</a>:
This is a plugin that lets you delete all pending comments at once. Useful for spam victims.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nksnow/">Snow and more</a>:
This one lets you see snowflakes, leaves, raindrops, balloons or custom images fall down or float upwards on your blog.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkfireworks/">Fireworks</a>:
The name says it all, see fireworks on your blog!
<br/>
<a href="http://www.rhymebox.de/blog/rhymebox-widget/">Rhyming widget</a>:
I wrote a little online <a href="http://www.rhymebox.com/">rhyming dictionary</a>. This is a widget to search it directly from one of your sidebars.
